## Two types of Geospatial Data Formats


1. There are many file formats for geospatial data that fall into 2 main categories: 

  * raster: divides the area into points/cells and specifies values for each point/cell
  
  
  * vector: use points, lines and polygons to describe entities in geographical space
  
  
2. Popularity/appropriateness of each will vary from case to case or from field to field


3. Working with raster and vector formats in R will typically require using different R packages.

## Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs)

How do coordinates get mapped to actual points on the surface of the earth?

  * When you are given geographic coordinates, often latitude and longitude, there are many implicit assumptions/simplifications being made:

    * a coordinate origin 
  
    * reference meridian (0 longitude)
  
    * datum surface: model shape of the earth
  
    * earth's gravitational constant, $GM$ 
  
    * gravitational model: to model sea level 
  
    * magnetic model


The entire system built on these assumptions/simplifications is referred to as a Coordinate Reference System


---
## There are multiple CRSs


  * <tt>WGS84</tt> (World Geodetic System 1984) is a commonly-used standard globally
    * Used in the Global Positional System (GPS)
    
  * Mulitiple other CRSs are popular in different contexts e.g. <tt>NAD83</tt> is widely-used by agencies of the US government 
    
  * Geographic region being depicted may influence the choice of CRS




---
## Projections

  * Impossible to project the surface of the earth onto a flat surface without some form of distortion 
  
  * The various mathematical systems that determine how the translation to a flat surface is done are called projections
  
  * Choice of projection, influenced by factors including:
    
    * location on earth
    
    * need to preserve shape
    
    * need to preserve size


---
## Proj strings

Geographic data often comes with a proj string

PROJ is an open source software application that translates coordinates from one CRS to another. 

  * proj=: the projection of the data
  * zone=: the zone of the data (this is specific to the UTM projection)
  * datum=: the datum use
  * units=: the units for the coordinates of the data
  * ellps=: the ellipsoid (how the earthâ€™s roundness is calculated) for the data

## Key point: Check your CRS and projection

  * If data comes from multiple sources, you may have to convert between CRS
  
  * The accuracy of some calculations, e.g. distance between two points,is predicated on using the correct CRS
  
  * An inappropriate projection may be harmful

## Other software underlying r-spatial packages

R packages for geospatial analysis rely on other open-source software applications, including:

  * <tt>GEOS</tt> (Geometry Engine - Open Source) core geometric functions
  
  * <tt>GDAL</tt> (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library): converts geospatial data between different file formats.

  * <tt>PROJ</tt> translates coordinates from one CRS to another.
